In the past, I did a game protection software. The protection software is ensure security of a specific process. No other unauthorized codes can access to it. But, I didn’t bring full codes here. And I sell this software to others. So this is not an open-source project. According to the sale agreement, I can’t show others the full codes. I wish you can understand. But I can show you core thoughts or core structure of this software. Let’s you know what I did in this project. If you have any question about this, please let me know.
